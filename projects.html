    An unrestricted bassist, composer, and educator, Isaac has spent the past few years as an established member of the Boston music scene. Isaac works as a regular on-call sideman as well as a key member in a handful of diverse up-and-coming bands. After beginning his formal education with a focus on jazz and classical repertoire, Isaac has cultivated his sound in order to be comfortable in any musical setting, unrestrained by genres. Shortly following his arrival at New England Conservatory Isaac was playing around Boston at such well-known venues as the Lilypad, Wally’s Jazz Cafe, The Beehive, and the Beat Hotel as well as the occasional performance at New York City’s Somethin’ Jazz Club, Douglas Street Music Collective, and Brooklyn’s Korzo. After receiving scholarship to the Conservatory Von Amsterdam’s and Manhattan School Of Music’s "Keep an Eye" Jazz program, Isaac attended the Conservatory von Amsterdam for a week and played with a big band at the Red Sea Jazz Club. Isaac was selected two years in a row to be in the New England Conservatory Jazz Honors Ensemble, giving him the opportunity to teach masterclasses around the greater Boston area and perform in Jordan Hall. Isaac has traveled to Panama twice as a visiting artist in the Panama Jazz Festival where he taught clinics on improvisation and performed alongside such greats as Terri Lyne Carrington, Dominique Eade, and George Garzone.

    Isaac has been teaching privately for six years and works as an assistant Faculty at New England Conservatory’s Jazz Lab during the summers. Isaac regularly teaches clinics on jazz music and improvisation around Boston and was a Visiting Artist in the Virginia Arts Festival where he taught 3 to 4 clinics a day for students ranging K-12 at a wide variety of school environments. Following his studies at New England Conservatory Isaac was invited to Berklee College of Music's Global Jazz Institute on a full scholarship. Isaac currently studies privately with Susan Hagen of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops. Past teachers include Dave Holland, Cecil McBee, John Patitucci, Ben Street, Danilo Perez, Jason Moran, and Miguel Zenon among others.
