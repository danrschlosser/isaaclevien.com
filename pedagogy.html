    Mentorship has been at the core of Isaac’s musical studies since he first took up the upright bass. Isaac quickly found himself in the midst of an intergenerational community of bass players and musicians eager to share their experience and to guide him forward. As a result it was not long, a single years into high school and his bass studies, before Isaac too found himself in the position of a mentor and teacher. Since then, the act of teaching and sharing has remained a keystone of his musical, artistic, and personal development.

    Isaac has consistently taught private lessons to bass players and pianists since 2010. He has also had the opportunity to teach over a dozen jazz clinics, including two separate visits to the annual Panama Jazz Festival to teach and perform. Isaac has taken music pedagogy classes and continues to research pedagogy on his own time. He has participated in workshops learning the basics of Suzuki, Kodály, and Orff Shulwerk methods.

    Isaac has had multiple students win statewide competitions such as positions in the All State jazz band and orchestra. His students have participated in music festivals around the country such as the Newport Jazz Festival and some have continued on to study at the collegiate level at schools including McGill University and Northwestern University.

    Today Isaac teaches group lessons to various beginner string classes through the El Sistema influenced Harmony Program. He continues to teach private lessons and also works in a classroom setting teaching 9th graders at the Heschel School where he learns more about music pedagogy and classroom management.

            <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>Personal development and discovery are at the center of Isaac’s teaching. His students are encouraged to find their own way to love music while being given all of the necessary tools to approach and understand it. With a background in jazz music it has been easy for Isaac to find a common thread throughout the many pedagogies he has studied. That thread is the ear. Whatever music his students wish to learn, Isaac works to develop their aural skills alongside their technical and theoretical skills. As a result his students develop not only as strong instrumentalists, but as versatile artists with a strong sense of taste and emotion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>After ten years of teaching, I feel that I've begun to develop a personal style. I've found myself zeroing in on a few key qualities I want to cultivate in my students and in my self. I believe that 'fit' is hugely important in teaching, and so I’ve written down some thoughts to help you decide if I'm the teacher for you. At the center of my practice both as a musician and an educator is a devotion to personal growth and discovery. I find this for myself by teaching in varied contexts, from school classrooms to one-on-one lessons, to sharing volunteer masterclasses with interested students as far away as Panama. Service is important for me: I'm lucky to be able to make my living doing this, and I feel it's part of my responsibility to teach as widely and openly as I can. No matter the context it is my goal to share with my students the lessons I have learned through music and to help them uncover their own. Some of these lessons are what one might commonly expect: from how to hold an instrument to basic music theory. On top of these skills we build more abstract ones: how to use music to improve oneself, to create joy and thought and feeling, or how to foster a strong collaborative environment in a band or project, the list is nearendless. As such I am constantly striving to inspire personal connections to the music and a stronger sense of community.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>I have consistently taught private lessons to bass players, pianists, and other instrumentalists since 2010. I have also had the opportunity to teach over a dozen jazz clinics, including two separate visits to the annual Panama Jazz Festival where I both taught and performed. I studied music pedagogy at Berklee and I continue to research pedagogy on my own time. In the last year I have participated in teacher training programs and workshops where I have learned the basics of Suzuki, Kodály, and Orff Schulwerk methods. Currently I teach music classes part time at a Manhattan private school and part time in an El Sistema based after school strings program.</p>
            <p>My students have gone on to win statewide competitions including positions in the Massachusetts All State Jazz Band & Orchestra and scholarships to summer music festivals and camps. Some have participated in festivals like the Newport Jazz Festival, while others continue their study of music at nationally-ranked institutions like McGill and Northwestern University.</p>
