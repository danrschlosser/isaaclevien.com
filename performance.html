            <blockquote>
                <p>&ldquo;The informality of the festival is one of its main attractions; in the above photo, bassist Lee Seung-Ha of the Panama Jazz All Stars shares the stage with bassist Isaac Levien of the ensemble presented by the Berklee Global Jazz project. Seung-Ha boldly asked the group’s guest artist, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington if he could sit in, and she said, “Why not?” The interplay between the two bassists provided one of many festival highlights.&rdquo;</p>
